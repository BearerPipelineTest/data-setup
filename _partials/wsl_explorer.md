## Ubuntu File System

We need an easy way to transfer files from Windows to Ubuntu and vice versa.

In order to do that, we will create shortcuts to Ubuntu directories in the Windows **File Explorer**.

Here are the steps:

- Open the Windows File Explorer (or use the shortcut Win + E)
- In the Address Bar, enter `\\wsl$\` (or `\\wsl$\Ubuntu` if it does not work)
- You now have acces to the Ubuntu file system
- Dive into the Ubuntu file system in order to look for directories of interest
- Drag the desired folders into the Address Bar in order to create shortcuts
