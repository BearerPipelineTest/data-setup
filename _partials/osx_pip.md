## Python packages

Now that we have a pristine `lewagon` virtual environment, it's time to install some packages.

First, let's upgrade `pip`, the tool to install Python Packages from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org):

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then let's install some packages for the first weeks of the program:

```bash
pip install pytest pylint ipdb
```

Let's install packages useful for API & Scraping:

```bash
pip install requests bs4
```

Finally, more Data Science packages:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly sklearn
```

That's it for today. During the bootcamp, we'll install more packages but we'll talk about that later.

If you want to check which packages (and which version of that package) you have installed
