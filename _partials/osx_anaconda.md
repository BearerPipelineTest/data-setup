## Anaconda

Time to install Python through the Anaconda distribution. Go to their [Product page](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section), select **macOS** and click on the Python 3 64-bit Graphical Installer (600+ MB).

Once downloaded, launch the installer until the end. That's it, Anaconda is ready.
