## Visual Studio Code - Your text editor

A text editor is one of the most important tools of a developer.
Follow these instructions in the Terminal:

```bash
sudo snap install --classic code
```

:point_up: This command will ask for your password with: `[sudo] password for <username>:`. Don't panick! Calmly type your password key by key. You won't have a visual feedback (like little `*`), that's **perfectly normal**, keep on typing. When you're done, hit `Enter` :muscle:.

In case you don't have `snap` installed - ask a TA for help.
Now let's try to launch your VSCode from **the Terminal**:

```bash
code
```
If the text editor opens in a new window, you can move forward!
